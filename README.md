# ROM-of-NS-Equation

We proposed a reduced order model for solving incompressible Navier Stokes equations using finite difference method on staggered grids. The idea is to select a finite number of POD bases using the proper orthogonal decomposition method (POD), and use the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) to select points containing effective information to reduce the dimensionality of the model. This allows the entire process of calculating the Navier Stokes equation to be carried out in a low dimensional space.  Numerical simulations comparing the POD-DEIM reduced-dimension model with the full dimension for the Reynolds number ùëÖùëí = 100 demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the reduced-dimension model, which achieves the effect of reducing the time consuming to 1/10 of the full model within an acceptable error range.
